# ML Models for Phase Prediction in Alloys

This repository contains code and models from the study:

**"Accelerating Phase Prediction via CALPHAD-Informed Machine Learning and Data Augmentation"**  
*Authors: Caroline Binde Stoco et al.*

## Contents

- `ML.py` – Complete ML pipeline
- `final_model_SVM_original.joblib` – SVM trained on original dataset
- `final_model_SVM_dist50.joblib` – SVM trained on augmented dataset (50% interpolation distance)

**Additional results** – including models for KNN, RF, GB, and SVM across all augmentation distances – are available upon request.
